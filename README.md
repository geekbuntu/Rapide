# Rapide

Rapide is a really simple, really fast blogging engine. Instead of using databses, it uses JSON files - this makes serving your blog up to 100x faster.

To install, simply upload all the files to a directory, and visit the URL. You must have 777 permissions on your admin directory (although they can be changed back to 755 after the install), and you must always have 777 permissions on your content directory (to allow for creation of the post files).
